## Overview
Order Summary Card Challenge by Frontend Mentor.

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out the Order summary component and get it looking as close to the design (provided) as possible.

### How to Use

Users should be able to: Use the Order summary component: 

- Clone the repository in any editor ( I recommend Visual Studio Code) or just download the zip file of code by clicking on Green colored code button.
- Extract the file and open it on your editor by allowing all the requirements.
- Now open the  index.html  and edit it or add details as you want for your project, and if you want to editing some styling so open styles.css file.

Happy development.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I Choose this project to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS especially different CSS properties like border, padding, flex, grid etc.

Some Code snippets of the concept that i follow to build Order summary component, see below:

```html
<div class="card-footer">
  <article class="first-item">
    <div class="music_icon"><img src="/images/icon-music.svg" alt="icon-music"></div>
      <div class="pricing">
        <h4>Annual Plan</h4>
          <p>$59.99/year</p>
      </div>
  </article>
  <button class="btn btn-change">Change</button>
</div>
```
```css
.card{
  width: 350px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  background: white;
  overflow: hidden;
  box-shadow: 3px 3px 3px hsl(228, 45%, 44%, 0.15);
  text-align: center;
  position: relative;
  padding-bottom: 20px;    
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on my path to a full stack web developer, i already completed HTML/CSS and JavaScript functionalities and now i'm focusing on remaining onces(React.js, Node.js, Dapps, APIs and Database).

### Useful resources

- [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - This helped me in using css properties like flex, animation etc. I really liked this platform and will use it going forward.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand z-index and shadows in CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
